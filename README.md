### "Designs by Traina" redesign

##### OUTDATED (as of January 2022)

This repo contains the code for my portfolio app built with Python Flask and deployed to Heroku. Site was previously deployed using FTP and code is [archived here](https://github.com/designsbytraina/portfolio).

##### About Me
I bring a creative eye to front-end and full stack development. With an intuition to ask, "Why?" I push those around me to think outside the box and create thoughtful solutions for everyday problems.

###### Let's make something together :v:
